# AnnaAnalyticsGUI
A GUI for an Analytical platform using a RESTFul backend.
This is a website built in connection to a RESTful api. The RESTful api is located at [AnnaAnalyticsRESTful python](https://github.com/Akelly982/AnnaAnalyticsRESTFulPython) on GitHub. 

---

## Installation:

I have been using XAMPP for my localhosting but you can use somthing else if you want to.

For XAMPP
1) Firstly put the AnnaAnalyitcsGUI folder in your htdocs folder for reference mine is here "C:\xampp\htdocs". 

2) Once that is done launch XAMPP and start the APACHE service.

3) The ADMIN button for the APACHE service should become active click it and select "AnnaAnalyticsGUI" in the browser that pops up.

4) Finaly Because this website works in connection with AnnaAnalyticsRESTfulPython you need to set that up. otherwise you will get and alert "Error 404 RESTful api" on index / homepage open. 

The webiste should work out of the box without any installs or additional work.
This website only uses JQuery externally. 
Note jQuery here is local './modularContent/JQuery3.6.0.js' I do this to avoid unexpected changes over time.
