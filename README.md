A GUI for an Analytical platform using a RESTFul backend


Installation:
The webiste should work out of the box without any installs or additional work.
This website only uses JQuery externally. Note jQuery here is local './modularContent/JQuery3.6.0.js' I do this to avoid unexpected changes over time.
